##ALDOT Cameras for Tuscalosoa <br>
I needed a csv with all of the cameras in Tuscaloosa from https://algotraffic.com/Cameras <br>
I found their API https://algotraffic.com/api/v1/layers/cameras but I hated their XML so i tried to save it locally and it saved as JSON.<br>
This script will pull the data from the saved JSON file and export it to a CSV
